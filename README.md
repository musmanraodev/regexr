RegExr v2
======

RegExr is a HTML/JS based tool for creating, testing, and learning about Regular Expressions.

It will launch on Mar 26, 2014 at [RegExr.com](http://regexr.com/)

After launch we will take a bit of time to clean up and organize the code before releasing it here. Until then this repo will be used to track bugs and feedback.
